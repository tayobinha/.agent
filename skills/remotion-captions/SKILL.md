## When to Use
- Use when this upstream workflow matches the user's stated goal.
- Use when the task requires the procedures documented in this skill.

All captions must be processed in JSON. The captions must use the [`Caption`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/captions/caption.md) type which is the following:

```ts
import type { Caption } from "@remotion/captions";
```

This is the definition:

```ts
type Caption = {
  text: string;
  startMs: number;
  endMs: number;
  timestampMs: number | null;
  confidence: number | null;
  pageBreakAfter?: boolean;
};
```
