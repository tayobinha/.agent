## 30-MINUTE RECON PROTOCOL

### Minutes 0-5: Read Program Page

```
Note:
- ALL in-scope assets (every domain listed)
- Out-of-scope list (read carefully — common trap)
- Safe harbor statement
- Impact types accepted (some exclude "low")
- Average bounty amount (signals program generosity)
```

### Minutes 5-15: Asset Discovery

Run the standard pipeline above. Focus on live.txt output.

### Minutes 15-25: Surface Map

Run gf patterns and the interesting-params grep above.

### Minutes 25-30: Manual Exploration

Open Burp Suite. Browse the app with proxy on:
1. Register an account
2. Perform main user actions (create/read/update/delete resources)
3. Note all API calls in Burp history
4. Look for endpoints not in your URL list

### After 30 min: Prioritize

```
Priority 1: API endpoints with ID parameters → IDOR candidates
Priority 2: File upload features → XSS/RCE candidates
Priority 3: OAuth/SSO flows → auth bypass candidates
Priority 4: Search/filter with user input → SQLi/SSRF/SSTI candidates
Priority 5: Admin/debug endpoints → auth bypass candidates
```

## Toolchain fallback (when `dnsx` / `httpx` crash)

The projectdiscovery Go binaries (`dnsx`, `httpx`, `naabu`) occasionally `SIGSEGV` on macOS arm64 due to a cgo / system-resolver interaction. The crash signature is identical regardless of install method — both `brew install` and `go install github.com/projectdiscovery/<tool>@latest` produce binaries that segfault at the same address. Smoke-test once before relying on them in a real engagement:

```bash
dnsx -version   # if SIGSEGV: use the dig fallback below
httpx -version  # if SIGSEGV: use the curl fallback below
```

### `dnsx` → `dig` fallback

```bash
# Replaces: dnsx -l subs.txt -a -resp -silent
while read s; do
  ips=$(dig +short +tries=1 +time=3 "$s" \
    | grep -E '^[0-9.]+$' \
    | paste -sd, -)
  [ -n "$ips" ] && echo "$s|$ips"
done < subs.txt
```

### `httpx` → `curl` fallback

```bash
# Replaces: httpx -l subs.txt -silent -status-code -title -tech-detect
while read s; do
  resp=$(curl -s -L -m 5 -o /tmp/body \
    -w "%{http_code}|%{url_effective}|%{header_server}" \
    "https://$s")
  code=$(echo "$resp" | cut -d'|' -f1)
  if [ "$code" != "000" ]; then
    title=$(grep -oE '<title[^>]*>[^<]*</title>' /tmp/body | head -1 | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g')
    echo "$s|$resp|$title"
  fi
done < subs.txt
```

**Trade-off:** Serial vs. concurrent. The fallback handles ~24 subdomains in 14 seconds; the same workload on `httpx` with default 50 threads finishes in 2-3 seconds. For VDP-scale recon (< 100 subdomains) the fallback is fine. For mass recon (1000+) fix the toolchain first.

Verified against HackerOne's own VDP in `docs/verification/recon-hackerone-vdp.md`.

## API Spec / Swagger / OpenAPI Discovery (2024-2026 surface)

API spec endpoints are the single highest-leverage recon target on any modern .NET / Node / Python / Java backend. The spec discloses every endpoint, HTTP methods, parameter names + types + formats, models, validation rules — a complete attack-map in JSON. Default routes are commonly left enabled in production. **Add this wordlist to the directory-fuzzing phase** (after the standard `common.txt` pass).

### Integration with the standard pipeline

```bash
# After live-hosts.txt is built (Phase 1 / 2), run:
ffuf -w swagger-paths.txt -u "https://FUZZ.target.com" -mc 200,302 -fs 0 -t 50 -o swagger-hits.json
# Or with httpx for content-aware filtering:
httpx -l live-hosts.txt -path swagger-paths.txt -mc 200 -mr "swagger|openapi" -json | tee swagger-hits.jsonl
# For every hit:
jq '.paths | keys' swagger.json > endpoints.txt
jq '.components.schemas' swagger.json > schemas.json   # mass-assignment field candidates
```

### Why this matters for recon-to-hunting handoff

- **Spec → mass IDOR/BOLA** — `jq '.paths | keys' swagger.json` becomes the input list for `Autorize`/`ffuf` per-user testing.
- **Spec → mass-assignment payload construction** — `components.schemas.UserUpdateDto` enumerates `isAdmin`, `emailVerified`, `tenantId`, `role`.
- **Spec → hidden endpoint discovery** — `/internal/*`, `/debug/*`, `/v0/*`, `/legacy/*` routes documented but never auth-gated.
- **Spec → injection-class seeding** — every parameter's type + format + enum + max-length means payloads pass validation before reaching the sink. Especially valuable against ASP.NET Core where the model binder rejects malformed input before any controller logic.

### Tools

- `kiterunner` — natively ingests OpenAPI spec, generates requests against the API.
- `sj` (Swagger Jacker) — purpose-built for Swagger spec exploitation.
- `apidetector` (brinhosa) — Swagger-UI mass scanner.
- `XSSwagger` (vavkamil) — detects vulnerable Swagger UI versions (CVE-2018-25031 family).
- `nuclei -t http/exposures/apis/` — built-in templates for default spec paths.

### Anti-pattern reminder

A 404/403 on `/swagger` does NOT mean no spec is exposed. Many .NET projects route the spec under `/api/swagger/v1/swagger.json` rather than `/swagger`. Always test the full path list, not just the root.

Full attack-chain analysis is in `hunt-api-misconfig` → `NSwag / Swagger / OpenAPI Spec Exposure`.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`offensive-osint`** — When recon needs concrete probes / wordlists / regexes beyond the basic pipeline. Workflow primitive: this skill produces the URL set; `offensive-osint` provides the secret regexes, GraphQL/Swagger paths, and identity-fabric probes you apply to that URL set.
- **`osint-methodology`** — When you need a severity rubric for what you discovered. Workflow primitive: after recon outputs `subdomains.txt` / `live-hosts.txt` / `urls.txt`, score each asset against `osint-methodology`'s findings rubric to decide what gets a finding versus what stays in the asset graph.
- **`hunt-subdomain`** — When recon surfaces stale CNAMEs / dangling DNS. Workflow primitive: any subdomain in `subdomains.txt` whose CNAME points to S3 / GitHub Pages / Heroku / Shopify / Azure should auto-route to `hunt-subdomain` for takeover validation.
- **`security-arsenal`** — When the URL set is classified by `gf` and ready for active testing. Workflow primitive: `gf xss/ssrf/sqli/idor` output names become payload-class queries against `security-arsenal`'s payload library.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When recon completes and Phase 1 transitions to Phase 2 (Mapping). Workflow primitive: hand the live host + URL set back to `bb-methodology` Phase 2 for endpoint mapping and Phase 3 vulnerability discovery routing.

### Cross-TLD pivot discipline

Phase 2C's HackerOne VDP recon walked from `hackerone.com` (24 subdomains) into a sister TLD `hacker.one` (12 more subdomains found in JS bundle references). Operators who only enumerate `*.target.com` miss attack surface that the target legitimately operates on a different domain.

Always grep JS bundles for plausible sibling TLDs:

```bash
# pull all JS, grep for sibling-TLD candidates
for url in $(cat live-hosts.txt); do
  curl -s "$url" | grep -oE 'src="[^"]+\.js"' | sed 's/src="//;s/"//'
done | sort -u > js-urls.txt

# then on each JS file
for j in $(cat js-urls.txt); do
  curl -s "$j" | grep -oE '[a-z0-9.-]+\.(io|app|one|dev|test|cloud|ai|co)' | sort -u
done | sort -u > sibling-tld-candidates.txt
```

Common sibling-TLD patterns: `target.com → target.io / target.app / target.one / target.dev / target.test / target-corp.com / target-cdn.net`. Always validate via WHOIS or by checking if the cert chain trusts the same internal CA before treating the sister TLD as in-scope.

### Subdomain wordlist priorities by 2026

Top discovery prefixes by hit rate against enterprise VDPs in our 2024-2026 corpus:

```
mta-sts.*          api.*              docs.*
dev-*              staging-*          *-qa
*-stage            *-uat              events.*
portal.*           customer.*         partner.*
vendor.*           internal-*         admin-*
employee-*         hr.*               jobs.*
sso.*              auth.*             id.*
```

Internal-looking subdomains often expose more surface than the marketing site — `partner.target.com` and `vendor-portal.target.com` frequently have weaker auth than the main app because they're scoped for "trusted" external users. Always send a probe to the long-tail wordlist after the standard subfinder run completes.

### Live-host probe: how to fingerprint stack quickly

`curl -sI <host>` headers are 80% of the fingerprint:

- `Server:` — apache / nginx / cloudflare / kestrel (= .NET Core) / openresty / envoy
- `X-Powered-By:` — PHP version, ASP.NET version, Express.js
- `X-Drupal-Cache`, `X-Generator: Drupal 9` — Drupal
- `X-Generator: WordPress` — WordPress
- `Via:` — CDN chain (1.1 varnish, 1.1 cloudfront)
- `Set-Cookie:` names — `JSESSIONID` (Java), `PHPSESSID` (PHP), `ASP.NET_SessionId` (.NET), `connect.sid` (Express), `laravel_session` (Laravel)

JS bundle filename patterns:

- `/_next/static/` = Next.js
- `/_nuxt/` = Nuxt
- `/assets/static/` with hash filenames = Vite
- `/static/js/main.*.chunk.js` = Create React App
- `runtime.*.js + polyfills.*.js + main.*.js` = Angular CLI

The first 10s of recon should yield a stack guess; the rest is targeting. If your fingerprint contradicts itself (Server says nginx, Set-Cookie says ASP.NET) you've found a reverse proxy front-end — note the origin app for later smuggling/cache attacks.

### GitHub Pages 404 vs takeover signal

Critical distinction operators get wrong:

- **"Page not found · GitHub Pages"** with HTTP 404 means the repo EXISTS — NOT a takeover.
- **"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"** means the repo was deleted — TAKEOVER candidate.

Same distinction for CloudFront:

- **"Error - 404"** with `Server: CloudFront` = distribution exists, origin returned 404 — NOT a takeover.
- **"The request could not be satisfied"** with `X-Cache: Error from cloudfront` = origin missing entirely — potential takeover.

Phase 2C verified both patterns live. Always check the EXACT response body string before filing a takeover finding — the takeover-scanner tools (subzy, subjack) match on multiple fingerprints and frequently false-positive on the "still owned, just empty" case.

### Toolchain fallback

Already covered in this file's Phase 2C addition. Quick reminder: dnsx/httpx may segfault on macOS arm64; the dig+curl fallback works for < 100-host runs in ~14 seconds. Don't burn an hour debugging Go binary panics when the fallback gets you to the same URL set.
